* nix-keyboard-shortcut-apps
Nix flake set up that enables packages and system services that enable advanced keyboard shortcut configuration e.g.

KMonad or Kanata installation

To consume on =nix-darwin= inside a flake:

#+begin_src nix
# using nix-darwin and nix flakes:

# flake.nix
{
  description = "flake consuming nix-kmonad"

  inputs = {
      nix-kmonad.url = "github:alexnguyennn/nix-kmonad/master";
  }
# ... other flake boilerplate
      darwinConfigurations = {
        # work macbook pro
        "my-machine-name" = darwin.lib.darwinSystem {
          modules = attrValues self.darwinModules ++ [
            nix-kmonad.darwinModule
            ./machines/my-machine-name/configuration.nix
          ];
          # ...
         };
      };
}
# ./machines/my-machine-name/configuration.nix
{ pkgs, config, lib, ... }:
{
   # set flake properties
   alexnguyennn.flake.kmonad = {
    enable = true;
    loadService = true;
    baseConfig = ''
      (defcfg
        input (iokit-name "Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad")
        output (kext)
        fallthrough true
        allow-cmd false
      )
    '';
    userConfig = ''
    ;; insert your kmonad lisp code here
               '';
    };

   # or use kanata instead / as well
  alexnguyennn.flake.kanata = {
    enable = true;
    loadService = true;
    configPath = "${homePath}/.config/kanata/config.kbd" # chuck your lisp in this file
    };
}
#+end_src


** Troubleshooting
- First =nix-darwin rebuild= may fail on =activate= at ~/Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager activate~
  - May need to download the pkg manually (see package derivation at ~./pkgs/darwin~)
    - open the package then try the activate again
- Service may fail to run on load due to not having =/Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/karabiner-daemon-shim= allowed in ~Security and Privacy > Input Monitoring~
  - use =Cmd-Shift-G= in finder to set path easily
- karabiner-daemon-shim was removed as kmonad is not used as a launchd service anymore (have migrated to kanata)
  - also adding it to the app bundle was  causing issues with the app bundle being signed
    - [[*Invalid code signature or missing entitlements][Invalid code signature or missing entitlements]]
      - the driverext expects the app itself to unchanged

#+end_src
- need to fetch from direct url rather than relative derivation path; hardcode url component to avoid this
*** Updating
- Bump in this repo and update sha256
- From consuming repo, update flake input to latest commitsha
- Apply changes as usual
  - expect rebuild to fail while trying to activate the driverkit extension:
   #+begin_src
ested
module.deploy_nix_config.null_resource.deploy_nixos_local[0] (local-exec): org.pqrs.Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice will be replaced to 1.6.0 from 1.0.0

   #+end_src
- Manually download the extension with =wget= and install via gui
- Run force activate manually: =/Applications/.Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager.app/Contents/MacOS/Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager forceActivate=
- Re-apply changes to nix and observe they complete as usual
*** Kanata
**** macOS
***** Upgrading Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager
- activation script will copy in the driver ext if it's not there yet
- has no way of knowing you're on an old version
- workaround - disable the drivertkit extension by disabling module to remove, then re-enable
***** Activating Karabiner-VirtualHIDDevice-Manager
****** Invalid code signature or missing entitlements
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       cb4119ca-6fb1-41cb-adbf-cfb4d33dc896
:END:
- sign that the app contents have been broken. this can happen when we extract the app contents of a =.pkg= and copy the .app paths later on
  - signature paths are missed
- install directly to avoid this
- can tell this is happening if activating the driver via the nix expression fails but running the install and then activating it manually via path works (but future activate breaks things again)
***** running from terminal fails
- Input monitoring permissions are required on macOS  (system preferences -> Privacy and Security -> Input Monitoring) are required for the parent process of =kanata=.
  - if running via terminal check that the path to the terminal app is added to Input Monitoring permission
***** running from terminal works but as a system service fails
- Input monitoring permissions are required on macOS  (system preferences -> Privacy and Security -> Input Monitoring) are required for the parent process of =kanata=.
  - if running via wrapper script, check that the path to the =bash|zsh|sh=  binary is added to Input Monitoring permission
***** running gives connect_failed asio.system:2
- a sign that we're not running an extra background daemon that =v5.0.0= and onwards require running.
- [[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/issues/1317#issuecomment-2456506215][issue indicating running daemon]]
- [[https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/issues/1264][related issue - apparently full install of karabiner elements will also do it]]
**** Checking keyboard input configured
- [[https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice#steps][the keyboard picker button is]] keyboard shortcuts -> modifier keys for some reason
- use this to check if the input set up by Karabiner DriverKit Extension is selected

** improvements
- [ ] namespace packages with =${system}= / figure out how pkgs work per operating system (make this work on linux too, not just nix-darwin)
- [ ] update darwin launchd service to be run as user instead of global daemon via nix-darwin (move to home-manager module instead?)
  - [ ] can we make a user service in nix-darwin?
